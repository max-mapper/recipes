The first thing I do is make my own stock, I use either chicken or turkey stock, whatever I have on hand. BTW- I make the stock before thanksgiving in my crockpot, refridge it overnight and you can scrape the fat off the next day.
I cut up onions and celery and saute in butter, take it off when done and set it aside.
I put the cornbread ( I made that a few days ahead and cut it into cubes to dry it out) in a very large bowl, add the onions and celery and my "secret" ingredient, which btw this the first time I've told anyone - I add chestnut spread to taste. I made it with chestnuts one year and everyone liked it. The next year the chestnuts I bought were all rotten and I had the spread in the house and figured I would give it a try. It was a huge success! The only problem I had, I didn't make enough!
Once you mix it all together, add your stock. Do a taste test and see if it's to your liking.
The spread is sweet, so add as much or as little as you like it.
I use to stuff the turkey but I not longer buy frozen ones so I put it in the crockpot.
If you want that added crunch, put some in a shallow pan ( spray the pan first) put it under the broiler for a VERY short time.
You might like it or you may look at it and think it's disgusting, please respect the fact that I took the time to post it with hopes that you will enjoy my recipe.
