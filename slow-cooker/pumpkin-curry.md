## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 600-800g pumpkin diced (1 small-medium pumpkin)
- 1 red onion, diced (I used a yellow one I had laying around)
- 2 tablespoons mild curry paste (I used red curry paste)
- 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 400g can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- small handful coriander, chopped (I think this is supposed to be cilantro)
- 3 tablespoons fat-free Greek yoghurt


## Instructions

Heat the slow cooker if necessary.  Mix the oil, onion and curry paste in the slow cooker pot, throw in the squash/pumpkin and give it a good stir, then add the tomatoes and chickpeas. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-8 hours until the squash/pumpkin is tender.
Turn off the heat and stir through the yoghurt and coriander. Serve with the rice and some chappatis, if you like.
