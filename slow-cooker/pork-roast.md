adapted from [here](http://jamiecooksitup.net/2011/11/balsamic-brown-sugar-glazed-pork-roast/)

## Ingredients

- 1 2 pound pork loin
- 1 t sage
- 1/2 t salt
- 1/4 t pepper
- 1 t garlic
- 1/2 C water

Glaze:

- 1/2 C brown sugar
- 1 T cornstarch
- 1/4 C balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 C water
- 2 T soy sauce
 

## Instructions

1. Place your pork roast on a pan, or plate. 
2. In a small bowl combine the salt, pepper, rubbed sage, and garlic. Press the seasonings into the pork roast. Spray the inside of your crock pot with cooking spray. Place the seasoned pork roast inside and pour the water along the edges of the roast. 
3. Cover and cook on low for 4-6 hours, depending on how fast your crock pot cooks things. The internal temperature of the roast reads 180 degrees.
4. In a small sauce pan, combine the glaze ingredients. Bring it to a boil while stirring and let the sauce thicken. (Should only take a couple of minutes.)
5. Drizzle some of the glaze over the top of the roast and let it cook for another 30 minutes. 
6. Remove the roast from the crock pot and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Slice it thinly, drizzle the remaining sauce over the top and your are ready to eat. It’s fabulous served with rice and a green veggie…or with roasted vegetables.
