## Ingredients

- 1 pound beef chuck, trimmed of excess fat and cut into thin slices (about 1/2 inch thick and 3 inches long)
- 1 small-medium onion, chopped (about 1 cups)
- 1/2 pound white mushrooms, trimmed and halved (or quartered, if large)
- Coarse salt and ground pepper
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream
- 1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- Cooked thin egg noodles, for serving
- Chopped fresh dill, for garnish (optional)

## Directions

In a 3 liter slow cooker toss beef, onion, and mushrooms with 0.75 teaspoons coarse salt and teaspoon pepper. Cover, and cook on low until meat is tender, about 8 hours (or on high for 6 hours).

In a 2-cup glass measuring cup, whisk cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water. Ladle 1 cup cooking liquid into measuring cup; whisk to combine. Pour into a small saucepan, and bring to a boil; cook until thickened, about 1 minute. With slow cooker turned off, stir in cornstarch mixture, then sour cream and mustard. Serve beef over noodles; sprinkle with dill, if desired.
