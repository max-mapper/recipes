[via](http://www.koreanbapsang.com/2012/10/slow-cooked-pork-belly-with-bulgogi.html#.UKbEzeOe_IY)

## Ingredients:

- 3 pounds fresh pork belly
- 1 medium onion
- 1 cup Sempio bulgogi sauce

### Optional Ingredients:

- 1 or 2 scallions, roughly cut
- 3 - 5 garlic cloves
- 1/2-inch long ginger piece, thinly sliced
- sesame seeds to garnish 

## Instructions

Cut the pork belly into about 3/4-inch pieces.

Heat a pan hot with a tablespoon of oil. Add the pork belly pieces in a single layer. Brown both sides. (You can skip this process, if you want.)

Place the sliced onion at the bottom of the crock pot. Add the pork belly on top. Throw in the optional garlic, ginger, and/or scallions. Cover. Turn the crock pot on high.

Cook for about 4 hours, until tender.
