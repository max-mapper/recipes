intended for a bread machine

- 8 1/2 ounces milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 1/4 cups bread flour
- 1 packet (2 teaspoons) instant dry yeast

Scald the milk (heat to just below boiling), then allow to cool to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (still hot, but won't burn when you touch).
Pour the heated milk into the bread machine pan. Add the salt, sugar, and flour. Start the bread machine on the 'dough/knead' setting. Allow the machine to knead until the dough forms into a ball (about 3 minutes). Stop the machine.
Pour the yeast onto the dough ball. Select the normal white bread cycle. Press start and allow to bake normally.
This is for a 1 1/4 lb loaf. You may have to adjust the ingredients if your machine makes a larger loaf.
