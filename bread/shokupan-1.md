## Ingredients for one loaf (20x10x8 cm)

- Dry yeast, 1 tsp
- Sugar, 1 pinch
- Warm water, 25ml
- Flour, 250g (you should use the kind of flour that's especially for breadmaking for a better result)
- Salt, 1 tsp
- Sugar, 1 tbsp
- Skimmed milk (I don't know if it's the proper English word, anyway it's low-fat cow milk) 1 tbsp
- Butter, 10g
- Warm water, 140ml

## Instructions

Start by preparing a mixture with the dry yeast, pinch of sugar and 25 ml of warm water. Mix well and leave aside for about 15 minutes.

Sift the flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle (it should look like a volcano ^_-) and pour the 140ml of warm water, sugar, milk and yeast mixture. Mix the liquid ingredients with the flour slowly, adding a bit of flour to the dough at a time.

Add the butter (cut into small pieces) and work it into the dough. Then transfer the dough to a clean table and mix it strongly and long, pulling it into a long strip and then rolling it into a ball again for about 200 times.

When you're done, the dough should've become very smooth. Roll it into a ball. Butter a bowl and put the ball into it, and cover with a cloth or cling film. Leave it for 1 hour in a warm (28-30°C) place.

When the dough's grown about 2.5 times bigger, remove the cover and punch the ball so that the gas that's inside it is released. Roll it into a ball again, and leave it (covered) for 30 more minutes. 

Take it out, divide it into 2 equal portions, roll them into two balls and put them inside a buttered plumcake mold, then cover it again for one final time (about 30 minutes). In the meantime preheat the oven at 200°C.

The balls should've become pretty big and stuck together inside the mold by now. Spray them with a bit of water and bake them in the oven for 25-30 minutes.
