Makes one 10" bread

- 1.5 c. bread flour
- 1/2 tsp. sea salt + more for the top
- 1/4 + 1/8 tsp. sugar
- 1/2 tsp. yeast
- 3/4 c. cool water
- olive oil
- a sprig of fresh rosemary

The night before, mix the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast together in a bowl.  Pour in the water and mix just until it becomes a wet, shaggy dough.  Put the dough in a bowl rubbed with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit at room temperature overnight.

The next morning, flour a board and use a bench scraper to turn the dough out onto it.  Gently form it into a ball.  Lightly coat the dough with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and let it rest for another hour.

About ten minutes before the hour is up, place a 10” cast iron skillet in the oven and preheat it to 450ºF.  Use your fingertips to dimple the dough into a 10” round.  Remove the skillet from the oven and carefully place the dough in it (I slid mine in from the plate it was resting on).  

Drizzle it with a little more olive oil, sprinkle the rosemary and another pinch salt.  Bake until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.  Carefully remove the bread from the skillet to a rack.  Let cool almost completely before slicing.
