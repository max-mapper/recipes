1 stick of really cold butter

in a big bowl combine:

2.25 c flour
4 teaspoons baking power
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
with two butter knives (though preferably a pastry blender as it will be faster thus keeping the ingredients colder) cut 1/4 stick butter into the flour cut the 3/4 of the stick of butter into slices and one at a time put them into the flour and smoosh them into flat butter pancakes with your fingers. its okay if they break into smaller pieces

add 1 cup of buttermilk. if you dont have buttermilk but a tablespoon of lemon juice into a cup of normal milk and let it sit for 5 minutes

as gently as possible with spatula or wooden spoon fold the buttermilk into the flour/butter mixture until it starts to stick together in small clumps. use your hands to combine it into one big mass

on a floured surface roll out the dough till its 1 inch thick and fold it in half. repeat this 3 - 4 times. The key is to be fast and gentle when handling the flour at all times so you don't activate the gluten. One trick is instead of folding the dough (which applies tension to the crease of the fold) you can instead cut sharply and gently stack the halves before rolling them out

with a sharp knife or biscuit cutter press straight down to cut the biscuits. make sure not to seal the sides at all.

if you have parchment paper put it down on a baking sheet and place the biscuits on it. melt a little bit of butter and dab it on top of the biscuits. don't let the butter drip down the sides as that will seal the sides. You can also try using egg wash on top instead of butter

put the oven at 400-450 (depending on your oven) and put the baking sheet on the top rack for 10-15 minutes until the biscuits look amazing
