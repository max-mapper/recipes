# Shokupan

## Ingredients

- 6 oz milk
- 1 package yeast
- Just shy of 1 cup vital wheat gluten flour (I filled a measuring cup to about the 6 1/2 oz line)
- Just shy of 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 4 oz milk
- 2 Tbsp shortening, melted
- additional flour

## Instructions

Heat milk until warm but not hot. Add yeast, stir to combine, and set aside for about 10 minutes.

Combine vital wheat gluten, all-purpose flour, sugar and salt in an electric mixer. Add milk and yeast mixture, beating until gluten strands develop. Add remaining milk and melted shortening. Add additional flour until a bread dough texture is reached. Change to a dough hook in the mixer, and knead for 10 minutes, adding a little flour as needed, until dough is soft and elastic, but not sticky. Shape into a ball, and place in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. I place mine in the oven with the light on.

Punch down dough. Grease 2 loaf pans. Divide dough in half. Divide each half into thirds. Flatten into narrow rectangles, and roll tightly into balls. Place 3 rolls side by side in each loaf pan. Cover and let rise for 1 hour, until dough rises to the top of the pan. 

Preheat oven to 400. Spritz tops of loaves with water. Bake 10 minutes at 400, then reduce temperature to 325 and bake an additional 10 to 20 minutes, until loaves are browned and sound hollow when tapped.

Let cool completely before slicing, or the loaves will go flat. It's hard to wait, but you'll be glad you did!
