# David Chang style chicken soup

[via](http://video.pbs.org/video/2306267884)

this recipe is a transcription of a video tutorial that David Chang did for PBS. 
it glossed over lots of things like quantity of ingredients and exact steps.

- get a whole chicken
- disassemble chicken into parts
- wherever there is a joint you cut along it
- throw em in a big pot of water

in another medium pot of water throw in:

- 2 white onions, halved
- a few spring onions
- couple of shallots
- 3 cloves of garlic
- peppercorns
- 2 carrots

then

- cook chicken until it is cooked through but not falling off the bone
- let it cool down
- pick the chicken off the bones
- season chicken heavily with salt, soy, black pepper + sesame oil
- boil the sh** out of it and then take all the chicken parts out leaving the broth
- add some veg broth, salt, soy sauce
- cook some (preferably fresh) noodles in the broth

to plate:

- put veggies and chicken parts in the bottom of a bowl
- cover with noodles
- cover noodles with broth
- cover it all with spring onion slices and/or an egg
 
notes:

when making this I couldn't decide if I was supposed to boil _all_ the chicken after seasoning heavily or just boil the chicken broth + bones (which is more normal for a stock/broth). 

I ended up boiling the whole chicken cut up into parts in water for about an hour and then took the meat off and put the bones back in the pot and boiled that all down for another 2 hours or so.

then since there was a lot of stock I froze some of it and used the rest for soup.

for the veggie broth I boiled it for 2-3 hours and then removed the veggies and refrigerated the broth that I didn't immediately use in the soup. I put about 20-30% veggie broth and 70-80% chicken broth in the bowls and it turned out well

so the main components are: the chicken broth, the chicken meat and the veggie broth. you also get some schmatlz after storing the chicken broth in the fridge. I discarded the chicken bones/junk and the veggies
